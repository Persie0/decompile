The paths cited below are paths inside the reconstructed Google Camera source archive.

## Confidence legend

- **Confirmed**: directly visible in Java/JNI declarations or native exported symbols/diagnostic strings.
- **Strong inference**: multiple native class/file names and control-flow evidence indicate the stage, but the stripped C++ implementation has not been decompiled instruction-by-instruction.
- **Unknown**: exact constants/weights/data formats are not recoverable from the current static pass.

---

## 1. High-level architecture

The implementation is split into a Java capture/control layer and a native C++ LightCycle engine.

```text
Camera preview + phone sensors
          |
          v
Java sensor fusion / capture controller
  eyi + eas + exp + exm
          |
          | filtered rotation + low-res preview frame
          v
LightCycleNative.ProcessFrame()
          |
          +--> target guidance / movement checks
          +--> TakeNewPhoto()
                    |
                    v
             full-resolution JPEG capture
                    |
                    +--> orientations.txt
                    +--> JPEG saved in session directory
                    +--> AlignNextImage() incrementally
                              |
                              v
                      native alignment state

capture finished
      |
      v
LightCycleNative.FinishCapture()
      |
      v
CreateNewStitchingSession()
      |
      v
RenderNextSession()
      |
      v
native final align -> warp -> seam -> blend -> JPEG
      |
      v
session.meta
      |
      v
EXIF + GPano XMP
      |
      v
MediaStore / Google Photos
```

The important architectural point is that Google does **not** continuously capture full-resolution images. It uses a small preview stream for tracking and only requests a full-resolution JPEG when the native target/capture logic says the camera is in an acceptable pose.

---

## 2. Main classes recovered from the APK

| Decompiled class | Role | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `com.google.android.apps.lightcycle.panorama.LightCycleNative` | JNI facade for the entire LightCycle engine | Native method declarations and `System.loadLibrary("lightcycle")` |
| `p000.foc` | Photo Sphere mode/module lifecycle, session creation, start/stop | Creates session directories, initializes LightCycle, finishes capture |
| `p000.exm` | Camera/LightCycle bridge | Selects capture type, requests stills, writes orientation records |
| `p000.exp` | GL renderer + per-frame capture state machine | Calls `ProcessFrame`, `TakeNewPhoto`, `AddImage`, target APIs |
| `p000.eyi` | Sensor state holder and orientation provider | Accelerometer/gyro/magnetometer state |
| `p000.eas` | Matrix-based sensor-fusion estimator | Integrates gyro and corrects orientation with gravity |
| `p000.exy` | Target manager/renderer | Calls `InitTargets`, `GetTargets`, `GetTargetInRange` |
| `p000.exw` | Gyroscope calibration state/UI | Calls `StartGyroCalibration` / `EndGyroCalibration` |
| `p000.exf` | Incremental alignment worker | Queues captures and calls `AlignNextImage` |
| `p000.exk` | Full-resolution still callback | Writes pose record and schedules JPEG persistence |
| `p000.ewo` case 2 | JPEG file writer | Writes captured JPEG bytes to path supplied by LightCycle |
| `p000.foa` | Finish-capture handler | Calls `FinishCapture` |
| `p000.eym` | Post-capture scheduler | Creates the final stitch task |
| `p000.eyb` | `LightCycleStitchTask` | Calls `CreateNewStitchingSession` / `RenderNextSession`, writes final metadata |
| `LocalSessionStorage` | Paths/state for an active panorama session | Tracks session dir, output, metadata and orientation files |

Because R8/ProGuard mappings are unavailable, names such as `exp`, `exm`, and `eyb` are generated/deobfuscated aliases, not Google's original Java class names.

---

## 3. Camera stream selection

### Confirmed

`p000.ewu.m7957a()` chooses two camera sizes:

1. a **small preview** size with approximately the same aspect ratio as the chosen still size;
2. a **full-resolution still** size.

The selection logic prefers:

- preview width below 640 pixels and as close as possible to **320 px**;
- still width close to **3000 px**;
- preferably a **4:3** still aspect ratio.

This is a major performance characteristic of the implementation.

The low-resolution preview is used for live tracking and capture decisions. The high-resolution camera path is activated only for selected source photos.

### Practical consequence

A clone should avoid feeding 12 MP frames continuously into the stitcher. A pipeline close to Google's design is:

```text
~320 px preview -> tracking / targets / pose
~3k px still    -> accepted source photograph only
```

Actual dimensions vary by device and supported camera stream sizes.

---

## 4. Session initialization

### Confirmed

`p000.foc` creates a per-capture session directory such as:

```text
panorama_sessions/
  session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
```

The associated `LocalSessionStorage` contains paths for:

- the temporary session directory;
- the final/temporary mosaic;
- `orientations.txt`;
- `session.meta`;
- thumbnail/output bookkeeping.

LightCycle is initialized once with:

```java
LightCycleNative.Init(previewWidth, previewHeight, fieldOfView, progressCallback)
```

For the standard Photo Sphere mode, `p000.exm.m8010h()` calls:

```text
ResetForPhotoSphereCapture(sessionDirectory, fieldOfView)
```

The same engine also implements:

- horizontal panorama;
- vertical panorama;
- wide angle;
- fisheye;
- calibration capture.

The UI type mapping in 8.8 is:

1. Photo Sphere
2. Horizontal
3. Vertical
4. Wide angle
5. Fisheye

---

## 5. Sensor pipeline

### Sensors registered

`p000.eyh` registers:

- Android sensor type 1: accelerometer;
- Android sensor type 4: gyroscope;
- Android sensor type 2: magnetic field.

The accelerometer and gyroscope are registered at a high update rate; the magnetometer is slower.

### Orientation estimator

The sensor events are handled in `p000.dvd`, case 2.

The gyroscope is time-integrated into the orientation estimator in `p000.eas`. The accelerometer supplies gravity information used to correct drift.

`p000.eas` contains rotation/covariance matrices and an update step that is consistent with a **Kalman/EKF-style orientation estimator**. That description is a strong inference from the recovered math, not an original class name.

The magnetometer is not part of the main high-frequency `eas` update visible in Java. Instead, accelerometer + magnetometer are also used when a source image is captured to derive a compass heading for capture metadata.

### Rotation handed to LightCycle

`p000.eyi.m8046f()` returns a 4x4 filtered rotation matrix. It applies coordinate-system corrections for camera/display orientation.

During rendering, `p000.exp` executes:

```text
rotation = sensorFusion.getRotation()
LightCycleNative.SetFilteredRotation(rotation)
```

Therefore the native engine receives a continuously updated sensor pose even before visual alignment of a full-resolution image occurs.

---

## 6. Gyroscope calibration

### Confirmed

LightCycle performs a short gyro calibration sequence around target acquisition:

- `StartGyroCalibration(fov)`
- Java accumulates integrated gyro values, sample count, and elapsed time.
- `EndGyroCalibration(integratedGyro, sampleCount, elapsedMs)`

The native method returns a three-element bias vector. The recovered Java UI logs/displays this result; the native engine retains its own calibration state.

This calibration is separate from the normal orientation estimator.

---

## 7. Target generation and capture guidance

### Confirmed JNI API

The native engine exposes:

- `InitTargets(rotation)`
- `GetTargets()`
- `GetTargetInRange()`
- `GetNumCapturedTargets()`
- `GetNumTotalTargets()`
- `TargetHit()`
- `ResetTargets()`
- `SetTargetHitAngleRadians()`

The returned `NewTarget` object contains:

- integer target key;
- target orientation matrix.

### Native implementation evidence

The native library contains:

- `PhotosphereTargetGenerator`
- `SingleAxisTargetGenerator`
- `WideAngleTargetGenerator`
- `CalibrationTargetGenerator`
- `TargetManager`
- target strategies including `TapToStart`, `InitFirst`, and `StartAtIdentity`.

Therefore target positions are not hard-coded in Java. LightCycle creates the coverage pattern natively from capture mode, current pose, camera FOV and internal overlap rules.

### Initial anchoring

When capture begins, Java resets its heading and calls `InitTargets()` with the current filtered rotation. This anchors the target lattice to the user's starting camera orientation.

### Adaptive target hit angle

The Java renderer adjusts `SetTargetHitAngleRadians()` based on gyroscope speed.

Recovered range:

- minimum approximately **2.75°**;
- maximum approximately **3.5°**.

The tolerance increases with angular speed between roughly 10°/s and 40°/s.

This is a small but important usability feature: target acquisition is not based on one fixed angular threshold.

---

## 8. Live preview processing and automatic capture decision

The core per-frame method is `p000.exp.m8012h()`.

For every available low-resolution preview frame:

```text
ProcessFrame(previewBytes, width, height, calibrationFlag)
        |
        +--> estimated frame geometry / pose
        +--> internal tracking update

TakeNewPhoto()
MovingTooFast()
TargetHit()
PhotoSkippedTooFast()
```

### Capture condition

Java only starts a real still capture if:

- `TakeNewPhoto()` is true;
- the frame returned a valid tracking result;
- a photo is not already being captured;
- the module is in an allowed state.

This means target selection, motion gating, overlap/tracking quality, and capture timing are mainly native decisions.

### User feedback

The native engine exposes two different movement signals:

- `MovingTooFast()`
- `PhotoSkippedTooFast()`

Java uses these to show the "too fast" warning and to cancel/end calibration or target-hit state when motion becomes unsuitable.

---

## 9. What happens when a source photo is accepted

This is one of the most important recovered sequences.

### Step 1: preserve pose

When `TakeNewPhoto()` fires, `p000.exp` copies the current native frame transform/pose.

### Step 2: tell LightCycle an image is coming

Java calls:

```text
LightCycleNative.AddImage(pose)
```

`AddImage()` returns a **file path** where the corresponding full-resolution JPEG is expected to be stored.

### Step 3: request a full-resolution camera still

`p000.exi` asks the camera controller for a still image.

It also records capture-time state such as pitch and location/heading information.

### Step 4: camera JPEG callback

`p000.exk.mo2774a(byte[] jpeg)` receives the actual JPEG bytes.

At this point Java:

1. records the current 3x3 rotation values in `orientations.txt`;
2. passes the JPEG bytes to the file worker;
3. checks whether all native targets have now been captured.

### Step 5: persist JPEG

`p000.ewo`, case 2:

- removes the next destination path returned by `AddImage()`;
- writes the JPEG bytes to that file;
- associates the file with the capture metadata;
- queues the completed file path for incremental alignment.

So the native engine controls the session image naming/path, while Java owns the Camera API and physical JPEG write.

---

## 10. Incremental alignment during capture

### Confirmed

`p000.exf` is an `IncrementalAligner` thread.

Every completed source JPEG is queued. For queued images it executes:

```text
LightCycleNative.AlignNextImage()
```

This is done **while the user is still capturing** the sphere.

Consequences:

- some expensive registration work is moved out of the final processing stage;
- bad geometry can be detected before the end;
- the native session maintains an increasingly aligned camera "rosette".

The library has explicit error text:

```text
Previous photos have not been aligned.
There are no images to align in the list
Alignment did not converge.
```

This confirms alignment is a persistent per-session process rather than a single batch operation at the very end.

---

## 11. Native alignment algorithm

The actual implementation is inside the stripped `liblightcycle.so`, but a large amount of architecture remains in symbols, RTTI names, source-file strings and assertions.

### 11.1 Sensor pose as an initial prior — confirmed

Native strings reference:

- sensor rosettes;
- image rosettes;
- sensor constraints;
- `CameraRotationModel`;
- `GetOrientationEstimate`.

The sensor rotation supplied by Java is therefore used as an alignment prior, not merely to draw the UI.

### 11.2 Image pyramids — confirmed

Native components include:

- `ImagePyramid`
- Gaussian blur pyramids
- fixed-point pyramids.

Alignment and blending are multi-scale.

### 11.3 Point features — confirmed

The library contains:

- `FastCornerDetector`
- `fast_9.cc`
- `OrientedPatchExtractor`
- `ImageFeature`
- `PatchPairwiseMatcher`
- `spherical_pairwise_match.cc`.

This strongly indicates the visual registration pipeline uses FAST-style corner detection and oriented image-patch descriptors/matching rather than a modern neural feature matcher.

### 11.4 Line features — confirmed

The library contains:

- `edge_finder.cc`
- `line_finder.cc`
- `LineFeatureComputer`
- `LineFeatureMatcher`
- `LineAligner`
- `line_aligner_utils.cc`.

Diagnostic strings explicitly mention RANSAC removing line matches.

This gives LightCycle additional geometric constraints in scenes with strong straight structures, useful for reducing panorama bending/drift.

### 11.5 Optical flow — confirmed

The library contains:

- `flow_constraints.cc`
- `CameraRotationModel`
- `GlobalFlowSolver`
- `FlowMotionModel`.

Therefore visual alignment is not based on sparse feature matches alone.

### 11.6 Spherical pairwise registration — confirmed

`spherical_pairwise_match.cc` is present.

This matters because Photo Sphere matching occurs on camera rays/rotations rather than treating every pair as a flat translational panorama.

### 11.7 Bundle adjustment — confirmed

The binary includes Google's panorama bundle-adjustment code and Ceres Solver.

Recovered residual types include:

- point-match residual;
- line-match residual;
- sensor residual;
- roll/pitch sensor residual;
- global focal-length optimization.

The native classes include:

- `BundleAdjuster`
- `BundleAdjusterGlobalFocalLength`
- `BundleAdjustedEstimator`.

This means the final poses are globally optimized across images instead of only chaining neighboring pairwise transforms.

A close reproduction should therefore model each source image as a camera orientation/projection and run a global nonlinear optimization over camera rotations and possibly focal length.

---

## 12. Camera/projection model

### Confirmed native classes

The library includes:

- `LinearCamera`
- `FisheyeCamera`
- `EquirectCamera`
- `RotatedVerticalEquirectCamera`
- `Rosette` / `StandardRosette`.

The "rosette" is the collection of source cameras/images and their estimated transforms.

The final Photo Sphere is rendered into an equirectangular camera/projection.

The library additionally exports:

- `RotateEquirect`
- `StereographicProject`.

These are extra projection utilities and are not the primary Java capture path traced here.

---

## 13. Exposure adjustment, seam finding and masks

### Confirmed / strong inference

Native rendering code contains:

- `RosetteImageAdjuster`;
- diagnostic text for **gamma exposure matching**;
- projection masks;
- `OptimalSeamMaskGenerator`;
- `SeamFinderGraphcut`;
- `ExposureUnaryCostComputer`;
- `LaplacianCbCrDiffComputer`;
- seam selection code.

This is strong evidence of the following render stage:

```text
project overlapping source images
        |
        v
photometric/exposure adjustment
        |
        v
compute overlap costs
        |
        +--> color/chroma edge difference
        +--> exposure-related unary cost
        |
        v
graph-cut seam optimization
        |
        v
per-image blending masks
```

It does not simply average all overlapping pixels.

---

## 14. Multiband blending

### Confirmed

Native RTTI contains:

- `MonolithicMultibandBlender`
- `YUVMonolithicMultibandBlender`
- `PreviewBlender`
- fixed-point image pyramid classes.

Assertions reference multiple blend levels and pyramid sizes.

Therefore final seams are softened with **multiband/pyramid blending** after seam selection.

The binary has a YUV path and a generic/RGB path.

---

## 15. Final rendering and JPEG output

The final Java stitch task is `p000.eyb`, whose logger identifies it as:

`com/google/android/apps/camera/legacy/lightcycle/panorama/processing/LightCycleStitchTask`

It executes:

```text
CreateNewStitchingSession()
RenderNextSession(sessionId)
```

A progress callback from native updates the processing item.

### Native rendering evidence

The library contains:

- `SessionRenderer`
- `SessionRendererQueue`
- `IncrementalStitcher`
- `Stitcher`
- `FastPixelMapper`
- render-in-chunks support;
- equirectangular mosaic rendering;
- libjpeg-turbo.

Diagnostic text shows a preferred direct YUV-to-JPEG path:

```text
Failed WriteYUV420ToJPEG, will try create and write full RGB mosaic.
```

So the engine tries to avoid materializing an unnecessary giant RGB bitmap when possible.

That is directly relevant to avoiding memory crashes in an independent implementation.

---

## 16. Capture completion

The Java side detects completion using:

```text
GetNumCapturedTargets() == GetNumTotalTargets()
```

The user can also stop early, producing a partial sphere/panorama.

Before final processing, the Photo Sphere module requests:

```text
SetOutputResolutionLarge()
```

Then `p000.foa` calls:

```text
FinishCapture(partialOrCalibrationFlag, mosaicPath, mosaicPath, timestamp)
```

After that, `p000.eym` schedules `LightCycleStitchTask` and the native renderer consumes the completed session.

---

## 17. Session metadata

The native renderer writes `session.meta`.

Java later reads at least these fields:

- `full_pano_width`
- `full_pano_height`
- `cropped_area_width`
- `cropped_area_height`
- `cropped_area_top`
- `cropped_area_left`
- `first_photo_time`
- `last_photo_time`
- `source_photos_count`
- `pose_heading`
- `yaw_correction_deg`
- location altitude/latitude/longitude/provider/time when available.

Native strings independently confirm the crop/full-panorama fields, source photo count and yaw correction keys.

---

## 18. EXIF and GPano XMP

After native rendering, `p000.eyb` adds normal EXIF information such as:

- make/model;
- dimensions;
- capture date/time;
- timezone/subseconds;
- GPS information when available.

It then writes Google's GPano namespace:

`http://ns.google.com/photos/1.0/panorama/`

### Confirmed GPano fields

- `UsePanoramaViewer`
- `IsPhotosphere`
- projection type (equirectangular in the Photo Sphere output path)
- `CroppedAreaImageWidthPixels`
- `CroppedAreaImageHeightPixels`
- `FullPanoWidthPixels`
- `FullPanoHeightPixels`
- `CroppedAreaTopPixels`
- `CroppedAreaLeftPixels`
- `FirstPhotoDate`
- `LastPhotoDate`
- `SourcePhotosCount`
- `PoseHeadingDegrees`
- `LargestValidInteriorRectLeft`
- `LargestValidInteriorRectTop`
- `LargestValidInteriorRectWidth`
- `LargestValidInteriorRectHeight`

`PoseHeadingDegrees` is derived from native `pose_heading + yaw_correction_deg`, normalized to 0..359°.

For Photo Sphere mode, `IsPhotosphere` is true. `UsePanoramaViewer` is enabled when the resulting horizontal coverage is sufficiently large; the recovered code uses a 70° threshold for Photo Sphere output.

This metadata is what allows gallery software such as Google Photos to recognize the flat JPEG as an interactive panorama.

---

  44. Publish final JPEG to the media pipeline.
```

---

## 20. Why Google's implementation is efficient on-device

Several design decisions explain why this can run completely locally:

1. **Tiny tracking stream.** Visual tracking is done from a roughly 320-pixel-wide preview rather than full-resolution camera images.
2. **Sparse full-resolution captures.** High-resolution JPEGs only exist for accepted target positions.
3. **Sensor prior.** Gyroscope/gravity pose gives image matching a good initial estimate.
4. **Incremental alignment.** Work is performed during capture rather than postponing everything until the user presses Finish.
5. **Multi-resolution algorithms.** Image pyramids reduce alignment and blending cost.
6. **Native C++.** The computationally expensive pipeline is in ARM64 `liblightcycle.so`.
7. **Direct YUV rendering path.** The final renderer attempts YUV-to-JPEG before falling back to a full RGB mosaic.
8. **Background rendering queue.** Final stitching is decoupled from the capture UI.

These are directly applicable to fixing memory/processing problems in a new Photo Sphere app.

---

## 21. Recommended architecture for our own implementation

A legally independent implementation should reproduce the architecture, not copy Google's proprietary native code.

```

For a first compatible implementation, the highest-value pieces to reproduce are:

- low-res tracking + sparse high-res capture;
- gyro-assisted orientation;
- native-generated coverage targets;
- incremental visual alignment;
- global rotation/focal bundle adjustment;
- equirectangular output;
- graph-cut/optimal seam selection;
- multiband blending;
- GPano metadata.

## 22. What is still unknown

The current static analysis does **not** yet recover:

- exact Photo Sphere target count and angular spacing for every FOV;
- exact preview pixel format passed to `ProcessFrame`;
- exact oriented-patch descriptor dimensions;
- feature thresholds and pair-selection heuristics;
- optical-flow weights;
- RANSAC thresholds;
- Ceres residual weights and robust losses;
- exact bundle-adjustment variable locking strategy;
- exposure/gamma model coefficients;
- graph-cut seam energy weights;
- number of pyramid/blend levels;
- exact full-resolution output sizing rules;
- native session serialization format;
- internal retry/failure thresholds.

Those require ARM64 disassembly/decompilation or runtime instrumentation of `liblightcycle.so`.

## 24. Next reverse-engineering steps

The highest-value next pass would be focused ARM64 analysis of these JNI functions:

1. `ResetForPhotoSphereCapture` — recover target-generator parameters and target spacing.
2. `ProcessFrame` / `TakeNewPhoto` — recover exact capture acceptance criteria.
3. `AddImage` / `AlignNextImage` — recover image preprocessing and incremental alignment options.
4. `FinishCapture` — recover session serialization.
5. `RenderNextSession` — recover alignment/render option structs, blend levels and output sizing.
6. `SetTargetHitAngleRadians` — verify how target tolerance interacts with visual overlap tests.

That should be done against this exact `liblightcycle.so` SHA so offsets and findings remain reproducible.
